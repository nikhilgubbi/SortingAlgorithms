This code demonstrates the four major sorting algorithms( Merge sort, bubble sort, heap sort and Quick sort). [Clemente's](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Sorting-Visualizer-Tutorial) has helped a lot in developing this beautiful tool. I am not ashamed to tell you that though I understood how it works, I was too lazy to type it again :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: .
